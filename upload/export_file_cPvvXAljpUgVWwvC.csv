	 New worksharing tool provides a consistent experience for all Renga users and makes it possible for the whole team to participate for better project delivery, even when they work remotely from each other. We implemented the ability to initiate a workshared cloud model so you can explore inter-team collaboration experiences when your desks are miles apart.

	 For more information on ways to share project work with other team members in Renga, watch our webinar.

	 Renga latest release delivers several new functionalities aimed at enhancing the modeling productivity for electrical power system. This is yet another new feature implemented exclusively for Renga MEP users. Now they can create electrical power system information models in Russian-made BIM system (Fig. 2) and generate all required documents. This has been made possible through the implementation of two important functionalities: parametric styles for lighting fixtures, electrical appliances and distribution boards that has been recently included to Renga tool set; and new routing functionality that allows to design electrical power system inside of a building.

<h4>New User Interface</h4>
<p>
	 Toolbars have been combined into ribbon-like sets, with each set designed for specific tasks. As you switch between different types of documents, the sets change dynamically. Users can work in traditional light mode or the new dark theme (see figure 1).
</p>
<p>
	 The new Quick Access Toolbar offers easy access to commands that select modes, control images, and more.
